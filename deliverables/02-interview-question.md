Cross tables
====================================================

The law of total probability, Bayes rule, and the sum-to-one rule are all 
properties of probabilities.  These properties can be described with 
a cross-table that includes the cell probabilities, conditional row probabilities, 
conditional column probabilities, and row/column margins.

Assignment
----------

In this assignment, you will produce a video blog post to explain how to 
use a cross-table to answer a popular job interview question often posed to 
individuals seeking a quantitative position.  

**Question:**

Suppose there are 5 coins.  Four of the coins are fair with *P(heads)=0.5*, 
and one of the coins is biased with *P(heads)=0.75*.  Suppose a coin is randomly
selected and flipped 4 times resulting in 4 heads.

*What is the probability that the selected coin was biased?*  That is, what is 
*P(biased coin selected | HHHH)*?


**Video Blog:**

The audience of your blog post is the undergraduate student body at Virginia. 
The blog post should explain how to use a cross-table to solve the interview 
question.  Getting the correct answer is not sufficient, the post must explain how 
you got the answer.

### Video creation instructions

1. Start a zoom session.  (virginia.zoom.us)
2. Record the session to the cloud.
3. Use the screen sharing and whiteboard features to explain the cross table and your solution to the interview question.
4. After you close the zoom session and the video is processed, you will get an email with a link to the video to share.

### Submission instructions

1.  Within your class repo, create a
    folder called `02-interview-question`.
2.  Within the folder, create the file `videolink.txt`.  The text of the file should be a link to the video.
3.  (Optional) Within the folder, include any visuals you used in the video.
4.  Edit the README to be an index for the portfolio.  
5.  Be prepared to share your video blog post with the class when the
    deliverable is due.

### Other instructions

1.  The deliverable should be your own work.
