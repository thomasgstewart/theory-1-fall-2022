# Probability & Stochastic Processes Fall 2022

## Overview

This course covers the fundamentals of probability theory and stochastic processes. The goal of the course is that students will become conversant in the tools of probability.  At the end of the course, students should be able to clearly describe and implement concepts related to random variables, properties of probability, distributions, expectations, moments, transformations, model fit, basic inference, sampling distributions, discrete and continuous time Markov chains, and Brownian motion.  The course will illustrate most topics with both analytic and computational solutions.
