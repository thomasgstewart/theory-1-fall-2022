# Course Calendar Fall 2022

## Final Exam

The final exam will occur between 8 December 2022 and 13 December 2022.  Students will sign up for oral exam slots in early December.

## Deliverables and Problem sets

There will be 12 assignments.  Some of the assignments will be traditional problem sets.  Others will be more substantial projects requiring the students to perform a simulation and summarize findings in a blog format.  Each assignment will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Students will have opportunities to resubmit each assignment multiple times within a 2 week window after of initial feedback.
